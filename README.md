Hello, welcome to my ReadMe!

Im 27yo at the time of writing, 10/18/24. Just starting off on my self-taught journey in the coding space. 
Currently, I build cell towers. As I watch my kids get older, spend nights in hotels, and wake up feeling myself get older, I want to be home with my family. I want a long term survivable career and skill.
Who didn't want to learn a new language, learn to code, learn to make a webpage or build a video game as a kid, create something?
It's time for a career change.
